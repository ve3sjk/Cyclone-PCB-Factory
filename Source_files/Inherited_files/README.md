Pre-development parts  
===================

These parts have been inherited from the original Cyclone. This means that they do *not* follow the latest version code standards.

All the parameters have been adjusted to fit the latest status of Cyclone 2, but *these parts will eventually be re-implemented to have the same global dependencies as the rest of the design*
