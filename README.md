Read this, it's important!
===========================
If you are reading this, then you are looking at the development version of Cyclone PCB Factory.
This means files may present inconsistencies (dimensions mismatch, lack of tolerances, etc).
If you just want to build the machine, take a look at the following locations:

- **Releases: <https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory/releases>**
- **Documentation: <http://reprap.org/wiki/Cyclone_PCB_Factory>**

Version 2.0  
--  

**Cyclone PCB Factory V2.0 was developed in the department of innovation and robotics at [bq](http://www.bq.com/)**  

V2.0 addresses all the issues from the original design, and implementing improvements by yOPERO, Martin Zabojnik and others.  

* More robust design with tougher parts:
 * Better holders for the linear bearings (vibration made them slide away)
 * Reinforced nut/screw holders
* Anti-backlash mechanisms
* Improved gears with smoother edges
* Protective cover for the gears
* Attachment for a vacuum cleaner
* Better scalability (parametrized design)
* Using a [Dremel 200](http://www.dremel.com/en-us/tools/Pages/ToolDetail.aspx?pid=200+Series) as the spindle motor
* Integrated endstop holders

Future improvements:  
--  
* Endstop integration for Z (integrated probe)
* Re-implement the Z carriage, currently inherited from Cyclone V1

Special thanks  
--  
- Plenty of feedback from **Pedro de Oro**, **Alberto Valero**, **Alberto Mendez** (and **Obijuan**, **Pacle**, **Jesus**, **Ana**, **Santi**, **Antonio**, **Jose**... :-P) at the _department of innovation and robotics at [bq](http://www.bq.com/)_. **Cyclone is much more user-friendly thanks to you!**
- Z axis concepts by **Quim Borras** and the spindle motor holder by **Misan** were really useful!! Also, **Diego Viejo**'s machine was of great inspiration for the Z axis (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/113930344830086538817/albums/5868944432651911713?authkey=CLDJgdehlN773gE>) **Thank you all!!**  
- This design woudn't have been possible without the encouragement of the **Panda CNC community** (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>)  
- Also, thanks to **Juan González-Gómez (Obijuan <http://iearobotics.com>)** for naming the machine Cyclone :)

Credit for the ideas used

The origin of Cyclone took place while I (carlosgs) was inside the **Panda CNC** community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102402711800402614517>). This is from December 2012 to mid-February 2013.  
Here is the credit for the ideas that were used:  

* _Let's design a 3D-printable CNC for PCB milling, it will be named Panda:_ **Guillermo Welch** (mid-December, via Google Talk)  
* _X carriage rod distribution:_ **César Augusto Fernández Cano** claims Cyclone's X axis is a derivate of his concept: <https://plus.google.com/u/0/111421387442355054591/posts/QrfYtEuZBaj>  
* _100x160mm workspace:_ **David Martin** <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/workplace_size.png>  
* _Using gears to drive the X-Y axes:_ **Guillermo Welch** <https://plus.google.com/u/0/101232926728463427403/posts/QjZGNcWcgGg>  
* _Regarding the woodbase:_ **Guillermo Welch** always contemplated the possibility of attaching the machine (optionally) to a woodbase. I decided to use the base as a main structural part instead. See <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/woodbase.png> (screenshot from <https://plus.google.com/u/0/113437723819360223498/posts/8LDCSSVWqCS>)  
* _List of CNC endmill types:_ **David Martin** <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16122275/PandaCNC_credit/cnc_endmill_types.png>  

Please note I have taken screenshots of the post that are on the closed G+ Panda community (<https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/116318709564872967169>). You can register and see by yourself.  

**All other development present on Cyclone has nothing to do with Panda and is not related to the Panda project.**
